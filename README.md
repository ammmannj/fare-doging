## General Introduction

Public transportation is of outstanding importance for your society since it ensures the mobility for a brought 
clientele, independent of social state and physical condition. In order to preserve public transportation and 
its financing, it is crucial to keep the fare evasion beyond a curtain limit. To realize this, fare evasion 
behaviour and its interference with the ticket inspection must be researched.

## The Model
The passenger and ticket inspector are represented by agents that show in a first step independent uniform 
behaviour. In a second step the behaviour of the agent is dependend on each other. The main idea of the passenger behaviour is that the probability of dodging fare increases with the time not being inspected and dodging fare successfully. This can then represent the situation, where ticket inspector plan their routes together and passenger share fare dodging experience. The public transportation network is implemented as a graph represented by a matrix, we will model a subset of the public transportation network of the city of Zurich. During the simulation the behaviour of the ticket inspectors is left constant whereas the fare dodging behaviour of the passenger changes due to their experience and his social environment. The values conducted by the model can be compared to some analytical estimations.


## Fundamental Questions

* What behaviour for the passanger leads to realistic results (compared to surveys eg. San Francisco)?
* What behaviour for the ticket inspectors lead to realistic results?
* What is the influence of the ticket inspector behavoir to the behavoir of the passanger?
* How can the ticket inspector behaviour be modified to minimize fare evasion?
* How can the ticket inspector behaviour be modified to maximize profit?


## Expected Results
We expect that if the passenger are not sharing experience a regional focused inspection leads to higher 
fare evasion rate, as the inspection rate decreases regionally and thus the dodging fare probability increases. 
If on the other hand experience sharing among the passenger is implemented, the evasion rate probably decreases 
dramatically, because the passenger “warn” each other of a regional inspection focus.

Agent-Based Model (humans can change their behaviour and interact, controllers and environement is static and doesn't change throughout the simulation)
